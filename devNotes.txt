TODO
    make monte carlo "random" moves slightly clever
        don't shoot unless there's an (enemy) target
        don't move into a spot you just came from

    refactor so commands don't need to know about their player/state up front

    unit test playthrough?
    try
        monte carlo with evaluation
        minimax with evaluation
            plug in strategies for each player
            learn/estimate strategy while you play??
        "mixed" strategy?

    optimise engine
        next steps:
            return just directions, create move/dig just before advancestate
            possibly bulk allocate list of all move/dig moves at startup
