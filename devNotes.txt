    if theres a tie choose random

    try
        monte carlo with evaluation
            why is it never shooting!?
            specify win state
            returns scores from playthroughs (not just +/-1)
        minimax with evaluation
            plug in strategies for each player
            learn/estimate strategy while you play??

    optimise engine
        next steps:
            return just directions, create move/dig just before advancestate
            possibly bulk allocate list of all move/dig moves at startup
