    finish runmatch script update
       store and display proper grid
       allow for infinite run
       look at using same seed for all matches?
       
   low hanging fruit improvements (update and then compare against previous bot and ref bot)
      Need to take KOs into account when evaluating!  not just score
         can i try to reproduce this and confirm it works 
            (maybe reference bot with specific seed)
            or just reference bot with my health real low
      Need to avoid getting lost
         one solution - bias towards moving in a direction
         another solution - low confidence, go for heuristic 
            aim for big clump of dirt if health looking bad
            go for enemies if health looking good
            run away if at a points advantage
      
    Tuning
       make bot tunable via config file
       update tournament script

    add new rules to engine 
       compare with previous bots after doing this

    add verifier test for engine
       compare with previous bots after doing this (and of course fixing any issues that arose)

    sometimes getting errors in my playthroughs

    

    try
        if theres a tie choose random
        monte carlo with evaluation
            bias moves in favour of continuing in the same direction
            getting invalid moves
            check which one is better, trim or no
            returns scores from playthroughs (not just +/-1)
            run sims on a per worm basis
            run matches with extended play time
                confirm that longer playtime makes smarter bot
                check if bot wins sooner with longer play time?
        minimax with evaluation
            plug in strategies for each player
            learn/estimate strategy while you play??
        "mixed" strategy?

    optimise engine
        next steps:
            return just directions, create move/dig just before advancestate
            possibly bulk allocate list of all move/dig moves at startup

    sort out deployment
        known issue: with cell.cpp (global method)
        known issue: with std::ceil line
        known issue: incorrect case in header includes
        copy bot folder
        drag in gameengine and random lib
        remove bin/rounds
        make changes to makefile (folders)
        get rid of all cerr?

insights from replays
        bots can get "lost" if they are in wide open spaces
            check confidence of next move, use heuristics if not sure?
            happened against nico beukes
        reference bot strategy is quite popular
