TODO
    optimise engine (low hanging fruit)
        next steps:
            return just directions, create move/dig just before advancestate
            possibly bulk allocate list of all move/dig moves at startup
    try
        minimax with evaluation
        monte carlo with evaluation
        "mixed" strategy?
    ENGINE - add some edge case tests
