TODO

    update runmatch script to do tournaments and tuning

    add new rules to engine

    sort out deployment
        known issue: with cell.cpp (global method)
        known issue: with std::ceil line
        known issue: incorrect case in header includes
        copy bot folder
        drag in gameengine and random lib
        remove bin/rounds
        get rid of all cerr?

    insights from replays
        bots can get "lost" if they are in wide open spaces
            check confidence of next move, use heuristics if not sure?
            happened against nico beukes
        reference bot strategy is quite popular

    spreadsheet profile of opponents

    add verifier test for engine

    sometimes getting errors in my playthroughs

    Need to take KOs into account when evaluating!  not just score

    try
        if theres a tie choose random
        monte carlo with evaluation
            bias moves in favour of continuing in the same direction
            getting invalid moves
            check which one is better, trim or no
            returns scores from playthroughs (not just +/-1)
            run sims on a per worm basis
            run matches with extended play time
                confirm that longer playtime makes smarter bot
                check if bot wins sooner with longer play time?
        minimax with evaluation
            plug in strategies for each player
            learn/estimate strategy while you play??
        "mixed" strategy?

    optimise engine
        next steps:
            return just directions, create move/dig just before advancestate
            possibly bulk allocate list of all move/dig moves at startup
